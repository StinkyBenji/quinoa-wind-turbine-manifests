 ü•∏ HINT: please follow the https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets#installation[instructions] to install sealed-secrets controller in `kube-system` namespace via Helm Chart.
 
 üëª BONUS TASK: consider different ways to install operators on OpenShift, and explain the different methods to the facilitator to get the points.

‚úÖ Grant *cluster-admin* to OpenShift GitOps application controller service account


‚úÖ Deploy *reloader* Helm Chart

Follow the command:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]	
----	
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts
helm repo update
helm install reloader stakater/reloader -n reloader --set reloader.isOpenshift=true --set reloader.deployment.securityContext.runAsUser=null --create-namespace
----	

== üî• *The challenge is getting real*
NOTE: the GitHub and Quay Setup can be done in parallel

== GitHub SetUp
- Fork the Git repo: https://github.com/StinkyBenji/quinoa-wind-turbine-manifests
- And fork the Git repo: https://github.com/StinkyBenji/quinoa-wind-turbine
- After you forked the repo, please run:
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----
git clone <your-forked-repos>	
----

== Quay SetUp

- Use `skopeo copy` to mirror the container image to your own quay registry:
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
skopeo copy docker://quay.io/stbenji/quinoa-wind-turbine docker://quay.io/<your-account>/quinoa-wind-turbine
----

== Racing car deployment
- Create the namespace: *quinoa-wind-turbine*
- The following steps will be executed in the same namespace
- Go to the cloned *quinoa-wind-turbine-manifests* repo directory on your local machine
- (provided that you are logged in to OpenShift on your local as well)
- Use the following command to create the deployment secret:
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
helm template helm -n quinoa-wind-turbine --set disableSecretsDeployment=false -s templates/env/secret.yaml | kubeseal -n quinoa-wind-turbine  - > config/sealedsecret.yaml

oc apply -f config/sealedsecret.yaml
----
- Create the argocd application using the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StinkyBenji/quinoa-wind-turbine-manifests/main/wind-turbine-app-tmpl.yaml[wind-turbine-app-tmpl.yaml]

- Once you are sure that all the components of the application is running smoothly, use the following command to get the route of the racing car game:
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
echo "The dashboard link: https://$(oc get route quinoa-wind-turbine -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n quinoa-wind-turbine)/dashboard"

echo "The game link: https://$(oc get route quinoa-wind-turbine -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n quinoa-wind-turbine)"
----

- Open a web browser to access the dashboard link to start the game
- Use your mobile to access the game link to play the game

==  üëª BONUS TASK 1

=== GitHub SetUp
- Create a https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token[fine-grained personal access token] (one token is enough for one team)
- Give the following permissions to your token:
[cols="2*,2*.",options="header,+attributes"]
|===
|**Name**|**Access**
| Administration| Read Only
| Metadata| Read Only
| Content| Read and Write
| Commit Statuses | Read and Write
| Webhooks| Read and Write
|===
- Ideally, set repository access to only select repositories, and select the repositories that you just forked

- Go to your cloned `quinoa-wind-turbine-manifests` repo folder
- Update the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StinkyBenji/quinoa-wind-turbine-manifests/main/0-github-secret-tmpl.yaml[0-github-secret-tmpl.yaml] to create a secret named `git-user-pass`
- Update the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StinkyBenji/quinoa-wind-turbine-manifests/main/0-quay-secret-tmpl.yaml[0-quay-secret-tmpl.yaml] to create a secret named `quay-push-secret` 
- Link both secret to `pipeline` service account 
 
 ü•∏ HINT: *oc secret link*

- Go to the foked *quinoa-wind-turbine* repo on GitHub and create a webhook in your GitHub repository
- Go to Repository -> Settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook
- Payload URL: 
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
----	
echo "http://$(oc get route el-wind-turbine -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n quinoa-wind-turbine)"
----
- Content type: `application/json`
- You can ignore the secret field
- Just push event is enough
- Create the webhook

=== Quay SetUp

- Create a https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.3/html/use_red_hat_quay/use-quay-manage-repo#allow-robot-access-user-repo[robot account] 
- Once the robot account is ready, click on the account and copy/download the Kubernetes Secret credentials 
- Add the robot account to the image repository and give it *Write* permission

=== Racing car modification
- Go to your cloned `quinoa-wind-turbine` repo folder
- Change `const` in the `src/main/webui/src/Config.js`
e.g. `export const ENABLE_SHAKING = true;
- Commit and push the change
- Observe the `pipelineruns` in the namespace 
- Observe the Argo CD application rollout
- Reload the game when the application is ready
- If you can explain the underlying architecture of the application deployment workflow,
you know what you are gonna get üòè
